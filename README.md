# Universal-Turing-Machine
Universal Turing Machine C#, first written in Java, was one of my projects from my computer science studies, which I rewrote in C#. Currently the application is built almost as in its java implementation. The goal is to refactor the project over time, which includes incorporating coding principles and design patterns. The project will be over-engineered in the future.
